* This site is for a fictional escape room (these are 'puzzle rooms' where you go in as a team and have to race the set timer to complete all of the challenges or puzzles and 'escape' in the alloted time) that has a Sherlock Holmes theme. Customers will be able to view the an explanation as to what an escape room is, the available rooms, their available dates and times and be able to book these time slots.

## Features
### Navbar - This allows the user to easily navigate the site with single clicks. I feel that each list item in the navbar gives a good indication o what is to be expecting of the page it links to.
* Home and 'logo links- both link to the 'Home' page which gives the user general information about the service provided, who it is aimed at and an FAQ section.
* Our Rooms page- Gives a description of the backstor of each room and provides a button which links to that rooms individual booking page.
* Book Now booking pages- Allows the user to book the selected room chossing a number of players, date and time they wish to play. Once complete the user can submit their choices and is taken to the next stage of the booking process which is to put in their personal details and card information.
* Leaderboards page- This shows the user the top 3 best times that previous teams have completed each room in. This is editable from the admin page.
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
* Contact Us page- Page with contact info and opening hours for users. May add in a map
* Log In page- Not yet functional

## Design

### Site theme   
* The original idea for doing a site based on an escape room came from working in one myself a few years ago. As for a Sherlock Holmes theme, that from recently watching a Sherlcok Holmes series and the title of the escape room part from being where the character lived, it is also my last name.
* Due to the choice of theme for the escape room, I wanted to give the site a Victorian look. This is why I have chosen the parchment background throughout and use Calligraffitti as the main font family as I felt it has the look of handwritting which suits the era as there were no computers.

### Colour scheme
* I chose a deep red (#8D0424) as the main colour for the headers and footers as I felt that it gave a plush feel and complemented the main background image. It also allowed the text in the navbar to stand out well. I used the same colour throughtout for the text to stay with a simple colour pallet and also because I felt it was easy to read against the background image.

### Background
* I originally decided to use a dirty white/ cream colour for my background as I felt it complimented the sites theme and would contrast nicely with the red and black. When searching for potential background images I settled upon parchment-background.jpg as I thought it's textured look and colour fitted the theme nicely and also worked well with the main colours I had chosen the navbar and text.

### Images
* I had originally envisioned 'Sherlock' related images of a deer stalker hat, magnifiying glass etc for the three rooms. However, when looking online, many of the images were either not appropriate or were too different in style, I couldn't find three that went nicely together. That is why I decided to use another parchment background with writting on them as if they were a note. This also tied in nicely with the game rooms themselves as all three rooms have a note or message as per their description.
